These are the dotfiles of my main Arch-Tower. Some of the files may be **very** messy, but I'm working on cleaning everything up. If you have any questions about anything, you can reach out to me on reddit [u/Channel_42](https://www.reddit.com/user/Channel_42).

# Vim 

Vim is my goto text editor and over time I've added more and more features. Functionally it has all the features I need from an dev IDE, with the main difference being way less bloat than your typical IDE.

To make the most of my "selfmade IDE" I added some bindigs to execute scripts or launch plugins:

| Binding | Funtion | 
|:--------:|:----:|
|Shift+s|compile current file|
|F4| open compiled file|
|F5| toggle NerdTree|
|F8| toggle tagbar|
|Ctrl+f| toggle focus mode|
|Space| toggle fold|
|Ctrl+space| create docstring|


# Firefox

![alt text](https://github.com/channel-42/dotfiles/blob/master/.resources/screenshot2.png "Screenshot of Firefox")

I use Firefox with a custom stylesheet (a pretty neat feature I didn't even know existed a couple of months ago). I modified a premade stylesheet from a fellowe r/unixporn member (see the themes section).

For my start/new-tab-page I use the Nighttab extension.

To setup custom stylesheets the following settings need to be changed;
- set the theme to dark in Firefox's settings
- enable custom stylesheets by setting `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` to `true` in about:config
- move the chrome folder to `~.mozilla/firefox/<user-profile>/`
- restart Firefox for the changes to apply
